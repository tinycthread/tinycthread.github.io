Is C11 unavailable for your target compiler(s)?\r\n\r\nThen you need TinyCThread!\r\n\r\nTinyCThread implements a fairly compatible subset of the C11 thread management functions.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Open source!\r\n* Very portable (designed to work under Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, and should work under most POSIX compatible systems).\r\n* Fairly faithful to the C11 standard (see the April 2011 draft: N1570, chapter 7.26).\r\n* Minimalistic (no external dependencies, and easy to include in a project).\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nFor the latest stable release, please visit the [TinyCThread releases](https://github.com/tinycthread/tinycthread/releases) page on GitHub.\r\n\r\nFor the latest bleeding edge, please checkout [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/tinycthread/tinycthread):\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/tinycthread/tinycthread.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe library is released under the zlib/libpng license, which makes it perfectly free to use for any application (including commercial applications).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
